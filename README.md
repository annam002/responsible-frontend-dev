# Responsible Frontend Development

Example project to demonstrate accessibility fixes for an in-accessible page.
Consists of the main page of an imaginary shop.
With every commit, the shop becomes more accessible.

Important: this example is *NOT* completely accessible. Among other things, 
there are known issues with screen reader accessibility and responsiveness. 
Feel free to experiment and make it more accessible.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the project
Start the shop on localhost:5173.

```sh
npm run dev
```
